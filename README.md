# Some-YAWMM-Mod
Based on YAWMM which itself is based on WAD Manager, modded up by various people.  
Changes from Fix94's Some-YAWMM-Mod:   
- Updated to be compiled in the latest devkitppc, libogc versions (tested in devkitPPC r40-3, libogc 2.3.1-1)
- Added system menu version numbers for the Wii mini so that installing a Wii system menu on it is possible

If you want to build this yourself as-is you need to get the [libwiidrc](https://github.com/Fix94/libwiidrc/releases) library and place wiidrc.h inside [include/wiidrc/](include/wiidrc/) and libwiidrc.a inside [lib](lib/)
